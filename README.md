## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
---

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- The vairables that provided a non-random amoint of variance are the intercept, ground_clearance, and vehicle_length.

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- The slope of the model is not considered to be flat. Since the p-value is significantly low (<0.05), it shows strong evidence to reject the null value which states that the slope of a line will be zero.

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- This model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively since the variables given to predict the dependent variable had a positive slope as well as high R-Squared values.
